# A Hard Negative-Aware Optimization for Multilingual Text-Based Person Search

This repository contains the official implementation for the paper: **"A Hard Negative-Aware Optimization for Multilingual Text-Based Person Search"**

##  Abstract

Multilingual Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) remains challenging in low-resource settings due to ambiguous cross-modal alignment. Although recent methods such as TBPS-mSigLIP employ noise-robust contrastive learning, they suffer from **limited gradient discrimination** between easy and hard negatives.

To address this, we propose an efficient optimization framework that integrates **Cross-modal Circle Loss** with **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**. Circle Loss enhances fine-grained discrimination via adaptive pair-wise re-weighting, while LoRA stabilizes training by constraining optimization to a low-rank subspace. We further introduce a **Curriculum Hard-Mining Schedule** to balance alignment stability and discrimination. Experiments across three typologically diverse languages — Vietnamese, English, and Chinese — demonstrate consistent improvements, establishing a new state-of-the-art **Rank@1 accuracy of 52.28%** on VnPersonSearch and **59.35%** on PRW-TPS-CN, with only **1.57% trainable parameters**.

## Current Status Snapshot

| Track | Current state | Next step |
|---|---|---|
| **Main training result** | LoRA + Curriculum Circle Loss reaches **52.28% R@1** on VN3K and **59.35% R@1** on PRW-TPS-CN | Preserve as the reported baseline |
| **NACIR** | Implemented as an experimental replacement for the auxiliary Circle branch; `run_nacir.sh` is available | Validate in `workspace.ipynb`, then run clean/noisy ablations |
| **Noisy correspondence** | RDE-style caption-shuffle noise is integrated via `dataset.noisy_rate` and `run_noise_experiments.sh` | Use for robustness experiments, mainly FP/noisy-positive validation |
| **Deployment** | LoRA merge, FP16/FP32 export, ONNX export, and **vision INT8 HTP compile** are working | Compile text encoder, benchmark on RB3, then repeat with real calibration data |

##  Framework Architecture

We propose a unified framework constructed upon the **mSigLIP** foundation model. To bridge the gap in hard-negative mining, we incorporate an **Auxiliary Cross-Modal Circle Loss** for geometric refinement and utilize **LoRA** on the Transformer backbone (Query, Key, Value, Output projections) to ensure optimization stability and memory efficiency (allowing **3x** larger batch sizes). Only **5.9M / 376M parameters (1.57%)** are trainable.

##  Key Contributions & Analysis

### 1. Theoretical Gradient Analysis

Why does mSigLIP fail on hard negatives? We analyze the gradient dynamics of the standard Sigmoid loss (N-ITC) versus our Circle Loss.

![Gradients](figures/gradient_3d_optimized_pub.png)

*Figure 2: Theoretical visualization of gradient magnitude. (Left) **N-ITC (Cyan)** exhibits vanishing gradients for semi-hard negatives (), leading to insensitivity. **Circle Loss (Red)** imposes a sharp penalty after the margin, effectively mining hard negatives. (Right) Circle Loss maintains strong signals for positive pairs even as they approach similarity 1.0, preventing premature convergence.*

### 2. Geometric Refinement

Our method transforms the embedding space geometry. By applying a **Curriculum Hard-Mining Schedule** (linearly warming up the Circle Loss weight), we prevent the disruption of early global alignment while enforcing strict spherical constraints in later stages.

*Figure 3: Geometric Analysis of Similarity Distribution ( vs. ). (Left) The Baseline distribution converges linearly to the decision boundary (), causing overlap. (Right) **Ours (LoRA + Circle)** lifts the distribution towards the theoretical margin (), creating a clear spherical boundary that separates correct matches from hard negatives.*

##  Mathematical Formulation

### Baseline Objective (TBPS-mSigLIP)

The baseline optimizes a multi-task objective over $L_2$-normalized image embeddings $\mathbf{v}_i$ and text embeddings $\mathbf{u}_i$:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{base}} = \alpha_1 \mathcal{L}_{N\text{-}ITC} + \alpha_2 \mathcal{L}_{MVS} + \alpha_3 \mathcal{L}_{C\text{-}ITC} + \alpha_4 \mathcal{L}_{SS}$$

**N-ITC** (Noise-robust Image-Text Contrastive) — sigmoid-based pairwise alignment:

$$\mathcal{L}_{N\text{-}ITC} = -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N} \log\sigma\!\left(z_{ij}\left(\gamma\,\mathbf{v}_i^\top\mathbf{u}_j - c\right)\right)$$

where $z_{ij} \in \{+1, -1\}$ indicates matched pairs, and $\gamma, c$ are learned scale and bias.

### Auxiliary Cross-Modal Circle Loss

We introduce Circle Loss to explicitly mine hard negatives via adaptive pair-wise re-weighting:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{circle}} = \log\left[1 + \sum_{j \in \mathcal{N}} e^{\gamma\,\alpha_n^j(s_n^j - m)} \cdot \sum_{i \in \mathcal{P}} e^{-\gamma\,\alpha_p^i(s_p^i - (1-m))}\right]$$

where $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{N}$ are positive/negative pair sets, $s$ is cosine similarity, $\gamma=128$ is the scale factor, and $m=0.35$ is the margin. The adaptive weights:

$$\alpha_p^i = [1 + m - s_p^i]_+, \qquad \alpha_n^j = [s_n^j + m]_+$$

dynamically amplify gradients for hard samples (poorly separated pairs) while suppressing well-separated ones.

### Total Objective with Curriculum Schedule

$$\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{base}} + \alpha_5(t) \cdot \mathcal{L}_{\text{circle}}$$

The curriculum schedule for $\alpha_5(t)$ prevents early disruption of global alignment:

| Epoch $t$ | $\alpha_5(t)$ | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| $t \leq 5$ | $0$ | Warmup (Circle off) |
| $5 < t \leq 20$ | $0.1 \times \frac{t - 5}{15}$ | Linear ramp |
| $t > 20$ | $0.1$ | Stable |

##  Installation

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pahmlam/Research_on_CircleLoss_for_TBPS-mSigLIP.git
cd Research_on_CircleLoss_for_TBPS-mSigLIP
./setup.sh

```

### 2. Environment

We recommend using `uv` for fast dependency management.

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv sync

```

### 3. Prepare Data & Checkpoints

Download the `siglip-base-patch16-256-multilingual` checkpoints and organize your datasets (VN3K, CUHK-PEDES) in the root directory.

```bash
uv run scripts/prepare_checkpoints.py

```

---

##  Training

Use the provided scripts for normal experiments. The scripts keep the Hydra overrides in one place and avoid long ad-hoc command lines.

### Train with Curriculum Hard-Mining (Recommended)

This runs the proposed method: LoRA + mSigLIP + Auxiliary Circle Loss with a warm-up schedule.

```bash
./run_cir_loss.sh
```



### Full Fine-Tuning Baseline

```bash
./run_full_finetune.sh
```

### Resume Latest Checkpoint

On the server, if training outputs are saved under the repository root `output/`
folder, resume from the newest `last.ckpt` with:

```bash
uv run python scripts/resume_latest.py
```

The script also reuses Hydra overrides from the selected run's
`.hydra/overrides.yaml`, so settings such as `+lora=default`, batch size, and
learning rate are restored automatically. Extra command-line overrides are
still allowed:

```bash
uv run python scripts/resume_latest.py +lora=default trainer.max_epochs=60 dataset.batch_size=24
```

Use a different output folder or config when needed:

```bash
uv run python scripts/resume_latest.py --output-dir output -cn cir_msiglip
```

If training is run from an active Conda environment instead of the repo `.venv`,
avoid `uv run` and launch the trainer with that same Python:

```bash
python scripts/resume_latest.py --use-current-python
```

### Train Baseline (mSigLIP)

```bash
uv run trainer.py -cn m_siglip img_size_str="'(256,256)'" dataset=vn3k loss.softlabel_ratio=0.0 trainer.max_epochs=60

```
